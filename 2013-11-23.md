Weekly Reflection: Due: Every Saturday by 5pm What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?

This week, we formed error analyzer group. Two of the analyzer group was merged. This new group is called ‘error analyzers.’ The reason why we merged is that our S.M.A.R.T goals for this course are accomplished in some sense because Lune’s code helped us a lot. 

This new group will analyze on errors. Specifically, we are trying to get an error diagram in order to compare each model, so we could conclude which model is best model among all. In fact, this task is very important. This error analysis is almost same as ‘residual analysis’ in statistical modeling. 

On Thursday, we discussed our S.M.A.R.T goals, and we also divide our sub-task, so that we are able to accomplish by next Tuesday.
