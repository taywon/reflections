What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)? 
 
The course Stat 157 is something I really love to take. During the spring semester, I was able to see the course description about this course and I figured out that it might be hard/time consuming since the course is about programming. However, I remember my stat 155 professor (prof. Mossel) told me that 'you might want to learn about programming language other than R. In modern days, it is essential to have those skills whether you go grad-school or industry.' Furthermore, I love to learn programming language ! :D So i decided to take a course and I found that my decision was good in the first day of lecture when you told us objectives of this course. 

The problems I had in past weeks are IRC nickname and installing ubuntu on my computer. At first, when I saw the homework1, I thought it is very simple task since instructor state all of the instructions as well as some pictures regards to that. However, the problems were occurred in the place where I didn't expect. First, I was not able to assign the nickname on IRC. In fact, I thought our instructor didn't actually want us to assign the nickname since he didn't explicit state 'register your nickname' on the homework. But it turns out to  be that he expect us to do that. In order to register the nickname, I search on the google about 'how to register the nickname on IRC?.' Thankfully, there were hundreds and thousands of document which has instructions for registering our nickname. Second, while I really don't know how to install the ubuntu in my computer, GSI and classmate helped me to do that. 

So far, from the past weeks, I've learned 'search answer for your questions' and 'classmates might know how to deal with my issue.'
