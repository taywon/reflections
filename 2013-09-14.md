What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?  
In this week, we’ve focused on installing ubunto as well as ipython. Moreover, it seems I’m being more familiar with github interface. 
I think the way professor set our group is very effective. Normally, if instructor didn’t assign the group, students tend to form a group with their friend. However, he puts two special task assigned student who into each group. This group helped me to follow the lecture a lot. For example, when I had a problem with installing ipython in my computer, our tech-assigned student helped me and I was able to install it very soon without any time loss. In my opinion, it seems each group will likely to achieve the goal of this course. I cannot wait to learn a lot of programming language latter in this course.
