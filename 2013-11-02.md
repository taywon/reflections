Weekly Reflection: Due: Every Saturday by 5pm What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?


Collaboration is hard. Well, it is not that hard if each of the group members is willing to work with other members. For example, I have sent emails to arrange our time to meet up and discuss about our assignments but no one is answering my email. This is so frustrating. I expect each member to answer within 24 hours for my email but it seems they really don’t care much about it. In short, this week is so frustrating in terms of facing hardness of collaboration. 
I’ve talked with Aaron about this issue and he gave me clear ideas. In fact, he told me that I should set a time for them to reply. For instance, “please reply my email within 24hours from now on.” Well, surprisingly, this works quite well. They started to answer my email. But it seems they are too busy to meet as a group but I will keep try my best to arrange our time for meeting. 


Also, I had a technical problem this week. I was trying to figure out how to share files between virtual server and my host server. I basically spent about 4 hours to do that but I failed it. The reason was simple, I shoot my fire up in the dark. It means that I just search for codes, which I think that might work, without fully understanding it. This led my guest server to face the dependency hell problem. So, I just destroyed my guest server, and I decided to go office hour and solve my issue. 
At office hour, I solved the problem, and I learn a lot. I’ve learned that how to use the website ‘stackoverflow’ and how to solve the technical problems by myself.


Also, on Friday, our analyzers attend Office hour and talked about key steps to achieve our goals. At there, we settle down our problems and we build our frame in order to achieve S.M.A.R.T goal. Before I get there, I didn’t have any idea about what we should do and how we could achieve our goal. It was really meaningful because not only I understand what I have to do as an analyzer but I was able to obtain the idea behind this assignment. One of the idea behind this assignment is, I believe, work as a group. 
Even though he didn’t specifically said what we have to do, we were able to get his idea and we were able to narrow down the problems into sub problems that could be achieved by each week. I think attending office hour was great idea. I hope all other group members could make a time to attend his office hour.
