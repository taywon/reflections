What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?
	This week was awesome. I really enjoyed the lecture about meadow and earthquake. Especially, it was helpful in terms of how the statistical analysis are implies in such a different field. In particular, when the professor told how the test were constructed (i.e permutation test), I was glad that the things I suffered to learn was used for real world data. If I had a chance to have those lectures again, I would like to ask lots of questions that I wondered. In addition to those awesome lectures, Iâ€™m sincerely appreciated to GSIs that they made a time for us on 09/20. This 3 hour catch up session was so helpful. I had a problem with installing ipython. Before Friday, I tried to install it by myself but I failed it even if I spent like 4 hours on it. But, with them, I could able to install the ipython-notebook on my computer. I probably spent additional 4 hours to install that thing!! (Thank you so much!)
