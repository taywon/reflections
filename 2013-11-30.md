First of all, Happy Thanks giving!


This week we had a presentation from guest speaker and Professor Stark. It was really helpful since they provide feedback to our works so we could focus on what we have to prepare at this point for final presentation. 


Also, our group, the error analyzers, is still in progress to make an error diagram. Because of great contribution from Bonghyun Kim, I think we could able to finish our whole ‘error diagram’ part by next week. If other members were struggling from their own part, I am very willing to help them, so we could finish it by upcoming big presentation. 


Furthermore, my last current group (analyzer subgroup 1 : Disi, Luera, John) is trying to write up ETAS model that we’ve worked on. So, last week will be summing all the things that we’ve done for this project.
