#What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?

I learned a lot this week. While we are doing homework, our group had many problems. In particular, our horizontal group and vertical group had each different problem. For vertical group, we decided to meet up on Saturday on campus. But it turns out to be that there was football game that day. So only few of us can make it. For horizontal group, my responsibility was analyzing data. We simply thought we could do this homework without meeting. Instead, we decided to talk over the email. However, after I analyzed the data, we had a problem. I thought assignment was very open so I used all variables to predict future career. In other words, I used different 10 columns to build model that predicts there future career. The reason was simple. There was nothing we could give an insight into class if we are only using two columns. So that caused a problem with our visualizer. Our visualizer was afraid that I used more than 2 columns. We talked about my analysis a lot. To me, it seems like they don’t really understand the methods/models I’ve done. But soon I felt “ah-ha!”. I realized that each of the group members has very different statistic knowledge. To be specific, I personally took 6 stat upper divisions while all others only took 3-4 courses. The method/analysis that I applied is something you cannot learn from those upper division courses. This experience gave me a huge lesson. In order to have group efficiency, we must rearrange each of our scope into group’s scope.
