Weekly Reflection: Due: Every Saturday by 5pm What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?

I think I learned a lot this week. First, I learned a lot from Professor Stark. Previously, I had almost no knowledge about earthquake prediction, but now, I know at least some basic stuff about earthquake prediction such as validating method for earthquake prediction model. Also, HW2 was fun. I used R for HW1 but I used python for HW2. The problem was that I haven’t used python for about 3 years. However, since I have solid R background, I could able to write a code quite fast. Stackoverflow was very helpful. When I had a problem, I simply search my problem on Stackoverflow website and there is at least one solution/method to fix my problem. Also, I had hard time for updating pandas package, but, again, stackoverflow rescued me. In addition, issuetracker was very helpful. Since all of stat 157 students were working on hw2, we have same problems such as using read_json. The biggest difference between hw1 and hw2 was that our group had a discussion before we get into hw. When we are doing hw1, we realized that we had very different scopes after each group member finished their job. Those different scopes led us to have time-consuming and less-productive discussions. But, for hw2, we discussed what we should do first, and that led us positive teamwork dynamics. But, if I had a chance to do this assignment again, I would’ve use the format that Aaron uploaded on git repo. I didn’t realize that he uploaded sample code for our assignment.
