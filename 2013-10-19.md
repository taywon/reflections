Weekly Reflection: Due: Every Saturday by 5pm What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?

First, I want to talk about Tuesday. In Tuesday, we had a time for reviewing other’s code with our professor. To me, it was really helpful. We all know how to write a code. We can either learn from class or learn from online. However, the problem is that “what is good code smell?” That feedback is what exactly I want to expect from this course since those kind of feedbacks could hardly get from online. 

About Thursday class, I had an unexpected phone interview from New york so I couldn’t go to the class. But some of my friends talked about what we’ve done in Thursday. So I kind of have an idea what was happened at there. It seems professor clarified grading issue and he also talked with class about future projects. 

In general, everyone seems to be a little overwhelmed about this course. They are auguring that this course is tough since professor didn’t actually teaching us about basic syntax and idea of python. In fact, I’m kind of upset since they are using that idea as an excuse. For example, one of my group (group 10) doesn’t even have an ipython notebook, and another member doesn’t even write any single line of python code for assignment. I think professor should make clarification about “learning syntax.” As far as I know, programming course is not for teaching syntax for specific programming language. Even Berkeley CS course does not teach you about syntax for specific programming language rather they teach how to write a code for specific purpose. I really am sick and tired of hearing all those whims about “he didn’t covered basic syntax and basic idea about python.” Please tell them leaning syntax is something we have to learn by ourselves, and basic idea of python is something you could automatically know if you tried to do your assignments.
