What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?


From this week, I learned how to form a group. Ah ha! Moment comes to me when we talked about idea beyond horizontal and vertical group. I think this is awesome. While I was taking CS courses and any other computer programming course, I always wanted that instructor assign a group like this. This group will not only save my time but also improve efficiency for entire students. Also, since I really want to be a data scientist, I push myself to work analyzing the data. I was visualizer and GSI helped me to be an analyzer !
