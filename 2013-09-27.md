On Thursday, we talked about our course title: Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science. First of all, honestly, I really didn’t know what the meaning of Reproducible is. All I know about reproducible is reproduce dataset which has same distribution as our given dataset. In fact, this is something I learn from previous stat upper division course. However, after Thursday, I think I got little more knowledge and understanding of what it is and why we need that. Personally, I think reproducible is really important. For example, I’m now doing some my own individual project and the dataset of the project is really unique. Hence, I really cannot find any new data set that I can test on. Instead, I applied typical statistical approach which is dividing the data set into training set and test set. However, this does not guarantees whether my model, which obtained from training set, is valid for other data set or not even if it works on my test set. 
Moreover, I found some article that reproducible is really important for researchers whom were researching any field that relevant to chemistry and biology. It seems our topic is really important in diverse field and I cannot wait to learn more.
